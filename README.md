## How to Use

### Clone the Repository and navigate to that folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FareedKhan-dev/digiart-Powerful-AI-Image-generator
```

```bash
cd digiart-Powerful-AI-Image-generator
```

### Create and Activate the Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv .myvenvname
source .myvenvname/bin/activate
```

### Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Running Digiart
To generate images using Digiart, run the following command
```bash
python digiart_diffusion.py --prompt "your_input" --c_time 400
```
Required two arguements:
* --prompt required (input prompt) example: `tornado approaching village` 
* --c_time (optional) but important to tune (the computation time) the higher the value the more it takes time to generate but possibility of good result, lesser value may result in no image.
  
| c_time                     | Value                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| 60-80                          | Recommended value for good internet speed |
| 100-120                         | Recommended value for below average internet speed |
| 150-2000                        | Recommended value for slow internet speed  |
